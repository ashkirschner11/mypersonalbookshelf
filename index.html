                  The person you want beside you in battle is the guy who has surrendered the outcome and surrendered to the fact that he might die.<br><br></p>

                <p>When you surrender the outcome, you are freed up to be at your best, to be in the moment, and to trust your training. It is the one who has surrendered the outcome who ironically has the greatest chance of survival.</p>

              </div>
              <div class="bk-content">
                <p>Surrendering the outcome doesn't mean you care less about the outcome or your process. It doesn't mean you don't give your very best. It means that you have surrendered the outcome that is outside of your control.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="bk-content">
                  <p>Many mornings I pray and surrender things that I desperately want to control, but I know I don't have control over. Surrendering the outcome is about having peace with that which is outside of our control without sacrificing the effort or care of what is inside of our control.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="bk-content">
                <p>Until you surrender the outcome, you will always be the greatest enemy to your own success. In order to reach your greatest potential you must operate with a heart posture of gratitude, commit to the controllables, surrender the outcome, and trust the process.‚Äù</p>

                <p>I wonder about the trees. Why do we wish to bear forever the noise of these more than another noise so close to our dwelling place? We suffer them by the day till we lose all measure of pace, and fixity in our joys, and acquire a listening air.</p>

                <p>They are that that talks of going but never gets away; and that talks no less for knowing, as it grows wiser and older, that now it means to stay. My feet tug at the floor and my head sways to my shoulder sometimes when I watch trees sway, from the window or the door.</p>

                <p>I shall set forth for somewhere, I shall make the reckless choice some day when they are in voice and tossing so as to scare the white clouds over them on. I shall have less to say, but I shall be gone.</p>

              <p>In The Sound of Trees, Robert Frost gets at that feeling of being torn between staying where you are and wanting to leave‚Äîkind of like questioning what ‚Äúhome‚Äù really means. He uses trees as a metaphor for people who talk about moving, dreaming of change, but stay rooted in the same place. It‚Äôs a quiet, thoughtful poem that asks: is home where we are, or where we‚Äôre meant to go? And what keeps us from making the leap? Frost doesn‚Äôt give a clear answer, but he captures that in-between space so well.</p>

The lyrics are so simple, but they carry so much weight. It is a song that makes you sit still for a second and feel all the change you have been trying to outrun.</p>

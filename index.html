              <p>In a world that often rushes by too fast, Winnie the Pooh reminds us of the quiet magic found in friendship, imagination, and the simple act of being together. Rooted in the gentle wisdom of the Hundred Acre Wood, this collection reflects on the stories that feel like home—soft-spoken lessons about love, patience, and the ways we carry one another, even when we're far apart.</p>

                  The person you want beside you in battle is the guy who has surrendered the outcome and surrendered to the fact that he might die.<br><br></p>

                <p>When you surrender the outcome, you are freed up to be at your best, to be in the moment, and to trust your training. It is the one who has surrendered the outcome who ironically has the greatest chance of survival.</p>

              <div class="bk-content">
                <p>Surrendering the outcome doesn't mean you care less about the outcome or your process. It doesn't mean you don't give your very best. It means that you have surrendered the outcome that is outside of your control.</p>

                  <p>Many mornings I pray and surrender things that I desperately want to control, but I know I don't have control over. Surrendering the outcome is about having peace with that which is outside of our control without sacrificing the effort or care of what is inside of our control.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="bk-content">
                <p>Until you surrender the outcome, you will always be the greatest enemy to your own success. In order to reach your greatest potential you must operate with a heart posture of gratitude, commit to the controllables, surrender the outcome, and trust the process.”</p>

              <p>In a world that constantly urges us to chase results, Chop Wood, Carry Water offers a quiet, powerful counterpoint: fall in love with the process, and surrender the outcome. This book is a meditation on patience, presence, and trust—reminding us that growth is rarely loud, and success is often found in the small, unseen moments. When we let go of control and lean into the journey, we begin to see that the process is the point—and that’s where the beauty lives.</p>

                <p>I wonder about the trees. Why do we wish to bear forever the noise of these more than another noise so close to our dwelling place? We suffer them by the day till we lose all measure of pace, and fixity in our joys, and acquire a listening air.</p>

                <p>I shall set forth for somewhere, I shall make the reckless choice some day when they are in voice and tossing so as to scare the white clouds over them on. I shall have less to say, but I shall be gone.</p>

              <p>In The Sound of Trees, Robert Frost gets at that feeling of being torn between staying where you are and wanting to leave—kind of like questioning what “home” really means. He uses trees as a metaphor for people who talk about moving, dreaming of change, but stay rooted in the same place. It’s a quiet, thoughtful poem that asks: is home where we are, or where we’re meant to go? And what keeps us from making the leap? Frost doesn’t give a clear answer, but he captures that in-between space so well.</p>

With soft defiance and quiet strength, this piece honors the contradictions of girlhood—the guilt and the grace, the sweetness we second-guess, and the innocence we cling to. Its a love letter to the in-between, to the days that dont make sense, and to the quiet hope that tomorrow, somehow, well keep going.</p>

                <p>Rule One: MAKE FAILURE YOUR FUEL<br><br>
                  Heres something the best athletes understand, but seems like a hard concept for non-athletes to grasp. Non-athletes dont know what to do with the gift of failure. So they hide it, pretend it never happened, reject it outright—and they end up wasting it. </p>
              </div>
              <div class="bk-content">
                <p>Listen: Failure is not something to be ashamed of, its something to be POWERED by. Failure is the highest octane fuel your life can run on. You gotta learn to make failure your fuel.<br>
                  When I was on the Youth National Team, only dreaming of playing alongside Mia Hamm. You know her? Good. </p>
              </div>
              <div class="bk-content">
                <p>I had the opportunity to visit the National Teams locker room. The thing that struck me most wasnt my heroes grass-stained cleats or their names and numbers hanging above their lockers—it was a picture. It was a picture that someone had taped next to the door so that It would be the last thing every player saw before she headed out to the training pitch.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="bk-content">
                <p>You might guess it was a picture of their last big win, of them standing on a podium accepting gold medals—but it wasnt. It was a picture of their longtime rival—the Norwegian national team—celebrating after having just beaten the USA in the 1995 World Cup.<br>
                  In that locker room, I learned that in order to become my very best—on the pitch and off—Id need to spend my life letting the feelings and lessons of failure transform into my power.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="bk-content">
                <p>Failure is fuel. Fuel is power. Women, listen to me. We must embrace failure as our fuel instead of accepting it as our destruction.<br>
                  As Michelle Obama recently said: "I wish that girls could fail as well as men do and be okay. Because let me tell you watching men fail up—its frustrating. Its frustrating to see men blow it and win. And we hold ourselves to these crazy, crazy standards.”</p>
              </div>
              <div class="bk-content">
                <p>Wolf Pack: Fail up. Blow it, and win. Rule Two: LEAD FROM THE BENCH<br><br>
                  Imagine this: Youve scored more goals than any human being on the planet—female or male. Youve co-captained and led Team USA in almost every category for the past decade. And you and your coach sit down and decide together that you wont be a starter in your last World Cup for Team USA.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="bk-content">
                <p>So…that sucked. Youll feel benched sometimes, too. Youll be passed over for the promotion, taken off the project—you might even find yourself holding a baby instead of a briefcase—watching your colleagues “get ahead.”<br>
                  Heres whats important. You are allowed to be disappointed when it feels like lifes benched you. What you arent allowed to do is miss your opportunity to lead from the bench.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="bk-content">
                <p>During that last World Cup, my teammates told me that my presence, my support, my vocal and relentless belief in them from the bench is what gave them the confidence they needed to win us that championship.<br>
                  If youre not a leader on the bench, dont call yourself a leader on the field. Youre either a leader everywhere or nowhere.<br></p>
              </div>
              <div class="bk-content">
                <p>And by the way: the fiercest leading Ive ever seen has been done between mother and child. Parenting is no bench. It just might be the big game.
                  Wolf Pack: Wherever youre put, lead from there.<br><br>
                  Rule Three: CHAMPION EACH OTHER</p>
              </div>
              <div class="bk-content">
                <p>During every 90-minute soccer match there are a few magical moments when the ball actually hits the back of the net and a goal is scored. When this happens, it means that everything has come together perfectly—the perfect pass, the perfectly timed run, every player in the right place at exactly the right time: all of this culminating in a moment in which one player scores that goal.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="bk-content">
                <p>What happens next on the field is what transforms a bunch of individual women into a team. Teammates from all over the field rush toward the goal scorer. It appears that we’re celebrating her: but what were REALLY celebrating is every player, every coach, every practice, every sprint, every doubt, and every failure that this one single goal represents. You will not always be the goal scorer. And when you are not—you better be rushing toward her.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="bk-content">
                <p>Women must champion each other. This can be difficult for us. Women have been pitted against each other since the beginning of time for that one seat at the table. Scarcity has been planted inside of us and among us. This scarcity is not our fault. But it is our problem. And it is within our power to create abundance for women where scarcity used to live. As you go out into the world: Amplify each others voices. </p>
              </div>
              <div class="bk-content">
                <p>Demand seats for women, people of color and all marginalized people at every table where decisions are made. Call out each others wins and just like we do on the field: claim the success of one woman, as a collective success for all women. Joy. Success. Power. These are not pies where a bigger slice for her means a smaller slice for you. These are infinite. </p>
              </div>
              <div class="bk-content">
                <p>In any revolution, the way to make something true starts with believing it is. Lets claim infinite joy, success, and power—together. Wolf Pack: Her Victory is your Victory. Celebrate it.<br><br>
                  As you leave here today and everyday going forward: Dont just ask yourself, “What do I want to do?” Ask yourself: “WHO do I want to be?” Because the most important thing I've learned is that what you do will never define you.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="bk-content">
                <p>Who you are always will.
                  And who you are—Barnard women—are the wolves.<br>
                  Surrounding you today is your wolf pack. Look around.
                  Dont lose each other.
                  Leave these sacred grounds united, storm the valleys together, and be our salvation.</p>

              <p>In her iconic commencement speech, Abby Wambach calls on women to break the old rules and write their own. Drawing from her experience as a leader on the U.S. Women’s National Team, she speaks directly to the next generation of women—urging them to trust their instincts, demand what they deserve, and lift others as they rise. Wambach’s Wolfpack isn’t just a call to empowerment—it’s a blueprint for building a world where women lead with fire, loyalty, and unapologetic strength.</p>

                <p>Air in my lungs, til the road begins. As the last of the bugs, leave their homes again. And Im splitting the road down the middle. For a minute the world seemed so simple. <br><br>
                  Feel the rush of my blood, Im seventeen again. I am not scared of death, Ive got dreams again. Its just me and the curve of the valley. And there is meaning on Earth, I am happy. </p>

              <p>View Between Villages by Noah Kahan is about returning to your hometown and facing the feelings that come with it—grief, anger, love, and the weight of the past. It’s a reflection on how people and places change, and how coming home can bring up both pain and clarity. The song captures a moment of transition, where old memories meet a new understanding of self. It’s honest, emotional, and deeply personal, while simultaneously questioning where home really is. </p>
